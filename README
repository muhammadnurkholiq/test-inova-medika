# Yii Version 1 Project with PostgreSQL Database

This project uses the Yii version 1 framework with a PostgreSQL database.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.x or newer.
- PostgreSQL 9.5 or newer.

## Database Setup

1. **Create a PostgreSQL database:**
    - Create the PostgreSQL database that will be used by the project. You can create the database using `psql` or another tool you prefer.
        ```shell
        psql -U username -c "CREATE DATABASE database_name;"
        ```

    - Replace `username` with your PostgreSQL username and `database_name` with the name of the database you want to create.

2. **Configure database connection:**
    - Update the database connection settings in the `protected/config/main.php` file. Example settings for PostgreSQL:
        ```php
        'db' => [
            'class' => 'CDbConnection',
            'connectionString' => 'pgsql:host=localhost;port=5432;dbname=database_name',
            'username' => 'username',
            'password' => 'password',
            'charset' => 'utf8',
            'emulatePrepare' => true,
        ],
        ```

    - Adjust the `connectionString`, `username`, and `password` according to your database configuration.

## Run Database Migration

1. **Run migration:**
    - Once the database connection has been configured, run the migration using the following command in the project's directory:
        ```shell
        php protected/yiic migrate
        ```

    - This command will run all migrations that have not yet been applied to the database. Ensure the database connection is correctly configured before running the command.

That's how you create a PostgreSQL database and run migrations in your Yii version 1 project. Be sure to test the project after the migration completes to ensure everything is working as expected. Thank you!
